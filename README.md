The Desk Height Meter is a simple and practical tool for tracking the height of your adjustable desk. By using a laser to measure the distance to the floor, it gives you an (more or less) accurate reading of the desk’s current position. Whether you’re switching between sitting and standing or just want to ensure consistent ergonomics, this device makes it easy to find and maintain your ideal height. Compact and unobtrusive, it’s a straightforward addition to any workspace.
